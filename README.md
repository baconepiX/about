## Quantative Analyst: Optimizing asset allocation to maximize  inverstors profit

I am a quantative analyst (so-called quant) with three years experience and I am looking for those who can work on a new Machine Learning project with me. I am a compassionate and innovative professional.  
First, I developed software for domestic financial institutions in Tokyo during 2012-2015. In addition, I analysed and optimized asset allocation for a domestic fund during 2015-2018.  
My skills include computer programming, mathematics, Japanese(native) and English(advanced).
